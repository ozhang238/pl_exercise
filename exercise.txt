1.  Write a program to strip out comments.
    Coments are in this format /* */ or //

    a. Bonus: Save and print out the comments along with line numbers. (not really necessary for later parts )

2.  Write a program to process `define, `ifdef, `ifndef, `else, and `endif.
    In this format:
    a.  `define <MACRO>
    
    b.  `if(n)def <MACRO>
        `endif

    c.  `if(n)def <MACRO>
        `else
        `endif

     step 1 : Create a program to list all the <MACRO> inside a given program and output to a file
     step 2 : read in a a list of macros that are defined , this format   

       ..
       <MACRO1>
       <MACRO2>
       <MACROn>
     step 3 :  Given a list of defined macros, strip out macros so that the program will work properly.
       print out file and try to compile and see output.

   **NOTE there are macros that exist in the format of `ifdef <MACRO> <some_value>. Don't have to solve for these right now


3.  Write a program that processes defines properly and ignores them when they are inside comments.
